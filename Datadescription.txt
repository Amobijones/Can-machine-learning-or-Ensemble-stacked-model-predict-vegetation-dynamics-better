1.	Elevation (EL) which is the altitude above sea level as provided by the SRTM DEM
2.	Slope (SL) was calculated as slope in degree.
3.	Slope Aspect (NS,DD) 
4.	Slope Length factor (LS)—sediment transport index—is the product of slope length (L) and steepness (S). 
5.	Topographic Position Index (TPI), which is used to determine the ruggedness of terrain, is derived by comparing the altitude of each cell in a DEM to the mean elevation of a specified neighbourhood around that cell 
6.	Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)
7.	Stream Power Index (SPI) 
8.	Distance from Stream (DS)
9.	precipitation (pre)
10.	initial values of Hurst exponent: Models were fitted for the vegetation persistence where anti-persistence (value between 0 and 0.5 and ≠ 0.5) and persistence (value ≥ 0.5) were coded as 0 and 1 respectively. The idea of the entire approach was not to predict Hurst exponent but to access its association with terrain attributes.
