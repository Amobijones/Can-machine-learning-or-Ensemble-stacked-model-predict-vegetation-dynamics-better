# Can-machine-learning-or-Ensemble-stacked-model-predict-vegetation-dynamics-better
The feature data include, Digital elevation model, rainfall, distance from road, distance from stream etc. Note the Hurst exponent was calculated using NDVI from about 30 years. with the Hurst exponent model. the Hurst exponent procedure was not shown here. However, this project tries to investigate how different machine learning models can best predict Hurst exponent and whether an ensemble model can do a better job. It appears that even simple model can predict better result than the stacked model in this project
